# IMDEX5 — The Imdex 5

An index of the five largest tokens paired with IMD on Ethereum mainnet (chain id 1), as one
contract, `Imdex5` (`src/Imdex5.sol`). The contract's own ERC-20 is the share: name
`The Imdex 5`, symbol `IMDEX5`, 18 decimals, plain transfers, supply 0 at deployment and no cap.
A mint issues shares, a redeem burns them, nothing else mints. Anyone can call everything; there
is no owner, admin, role, setting, pause or upgrade.

Contracts only: no launch token, pool or website.

## Layout

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `src/Imdex5.sol` | The index. One contract, no constructor arguments, 23,552 bytes of runtime. |
| `src/OracleAttestation.sol` | The protocol's `OracleAttestation` library and `OracleAttestationConsumer`, copied whole from the oracle-consumer reference. |
| `src/Interfaces.sol` | The slices of the Uniswap v4 `PoolManager`, the launch registries and the Intake that the index calls. |
| `test/Imdex5.t.sol` | Behaviour, failure and attack tests against mocks. |
| `test/Imdex5ResidualSpot.t.sol` | The residual attacks: a dumped residual whose buy reverts cannot be minted at spot; a residual hook that burns gas or leaves a delta fails the mint; a dumped pool that trades is bought in full; a short fill is charged at least its fair value. |
| `test/Imdex5DocumentedLimits.t.sol` | The documented limits of this launch's audit: a pool moved before a rebalance is traded at the moved price within a bound; a limited sale sells about 1% of the reserve; a failed or closed request costs the week; a failed request leaves every IMD accounted. |
| `test/OracleConsumerConformance.t.sol` | The protocol's digest and selector vectors. |
| `test/mocks/Mocks.sol` | Mock ERC-20 (can revert, return false or burn gas), a constant-product stand-in for the PoolManager (price limits, partial fills, short fills, the nonzero-delta count), registries, Intake, an ERC-1271 signer and a hook that re-enters, burns gas or leaves a delta unsettled. |
| `lib/` | OpenZeppelin Contracts 5.6.1 and forge-std 1.9.6, vendored as ordinary files. |

Build and test:

```
forge build
forge test
forge fmt --check
```

`foundry.toml` pins solc 0.8.26, optimizer 200 runs, `via_ir`, `cancun`, `bytecode_hash = "none"`.
Tests mock every outside contract by etching mocks at the mainnet addresses the contract hard-codes;
`test/Fix3*.fork.t.sol` are mainnet fork tests against the real pools: run them with `forge test --match-path 'test/Fix3*' --fork-url <mainnet rpc>`; without a fork they skip, so a plain `forge test` passes with no network. The other tests read no environment.

## Deployment parameters

The constructor takes no arguments, calls no contract and checks no code length. Everything about
the chain is a constant:

| Constant | Value |
| --- | --- |
| IMD | `0xD34a99Bc0f67aE1bbd63C660e6d0b0dd03E263B7` |
| Uniswap v4 PoolManager | `0x000000000004444c5dc75cB358380D2e3dE08A90` |
| Registry A | `0xA47FcB220DDd1cDddA865F89029BEc1b9EcA3bf1` |
| Registry B | `0x7c9D5ee697BfF5Ac4F10E2E54d3f40c44e48fE23` |
| Intake (version 2) | `0xa43e6F75ee006411F79Ac1C84120606C2330DE82` |
| Action | `bytes32("oracle.request@oracle-1")` |
| Oracle signer | `0x5598aa9146215bc13eb26f2c692ad1461fd32982` |
| Pool key | IMD and the coin sorted, fee 12500, tick spacing 60, hooks = the launch's hook |
| EIP-712 domain | name `IdentityMD Oracle`, version `2`, this chain, this contract |

### Starting list

The constructor seeds the list below. On 2026-10-13 both registries were read through a public
RPC: each launch is recorded in exactly one registry, and every `token` and `hook` artifact equals
the brief's value, so nothing differs and nothing was substituted.

| Launch | Symbol | Token | Hook | Registry |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1282 | INFER | `0x53d0eA0A685220718Dc6a0a6e4617194C6F37921` | `0x784FF9a3ac5d88A30bfff6F7f2a270161FBE6000` | B |
| 1283 | MARG | `0xfA0EfEa559bdE229031c2B0A219472316647759c` | `0xf0457dD0Cf526686190e4f057Ba19dB14D34a0cc` | A |
| 737 | ZTO | `0xd782Bdea4EF02a0Bd391eb9089470c8080f0A68e` | `0x784FF9a3ac5d88A30bfff6F7f2a270161FBE6000` | B |
| 1075 | SCAT | `0x54C68a4D0A21DBb1ad72FaA052db159d26F967EA` | `0x784FF9a3ac5d88A30bfff6F7f2a270161FBE6000` | B |
| 1175 | SC | `0x1ae93A4D9CC0b41C594D00387B6F832a88f729b7` | `0x784FF9a3ac5d88A30bfff6F7f2a270161FBE6000` | B |

### Numbers the brief left open (named constants)

| Constant | Value | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SQRT_UP_BPS` / `SQRT_DOWN_BPS` | 10100 / 9900 | A limited swap's sqrt-price limit is the spot sqrt price moved 1%, which is a price move of about 2% (2.01% up, 1.99% down). |
| `WEIGHT_DIVISOR` | 4 | The 25% weight cap. |
| `MAX_LIST` | 5 | The most launch numbers an answer may carry. |
| `MIN_AGREED` | 4 | The panel agreement `onOracleResult` requires. |
| `SWAP_GAS` | 1,000,000 | Gas given to each skippable swap (`swapSelf` from `rebalance` and `redeemToImd`). A hook that burns everything it is given costs at most this much per swap, so the rest of the call still runs. A swap that needs more is skipped (or, in `redeemToImd`, paid in kind). |
| `PAY_GAS` | 300,000 | Gas given to each coin transfer in `redeem` and the in-kind part of `redeemToImd`. A coin that burns it all becomes owed instead of starving the next payment. |

## How it works

### Accounting

Internal accounting, with swap receipts measured using the output token's `balanceOf` before
and after the PoolManager's `take`:

- `held[coin]`: units of each coin the index owns for its holders.
- `idleImd`: IMD a rebalance left unspent. The holders'.
- `feeImd`: fees. Outside every mint, redeem and rebalance; it only ever pays the oracle price
  (0.5 IMD) and caller rewards (0.25 IMD). `fund(amount)` lets anyone add to it.

After accounted operations, the IMD the contract holds equals `idleImd + feeImd` plus any IMD
recorded as `owed`. Each coin's balance equals `held[coin]` plus the amounts recorded as `owed`.
The invariant suites check these equalities with both plain coins and a SwarmCity mock that keeps
2% of transfers out of the PoolManager. `held` increases only by what actually arrives, and
`Swapped.amountOut` reports that receipt, including for rebalance buys.

### Mint

- `mintFirst(imdIn, minOut[])`: only at supply 0. 0.50% of `imdIn` goes to `feeImd`; the rest
  buys each coin of the list with an equal IMD part and mints one share per IMD of the rest.
  The IMD the swaps did not consume (the division's remainder, and whatever a pool whose
  liquidity ran out could not take, which v4 reports in the swap's delta) goes to `idleImd`, so
  every IMD the contract holds is accounted for. Reverts if a buy reverts, returns nothing (a
  dust input the pool fee swallows whole is a failed buy, not a share for nothing) or returns
  under its `minOut`. `minOut` has one entry per coin of the list, in list order.
- `mint(shares, maxImdIn, minShares)`: supply > 0. Pulls `maxImdIn` first, requests exactly `held * f` of every
  coin (`f = shares / totalSupply`, rounded up), adds 0.50% of the buys' cost to `feeImd`, mints,
  and refunds the unspent IMD. Starts with `minted = shares`; for each short fill, reduces it to
  the smaller of its current value and `floor(shares * received / need)`. Then adds
  `idleImd * minted / totalSupply` (rounded up) to `idleImd`: the idle contribution follows the
  shares issued, not the shares asked for, so a short fill never charges idle IMD the new shares
  do not own. It issues and emits `minted`. Reverts if the total exceeds
  `maxImdIn`, if the total is zero (a share is never issued for nothing), if a buy reverts, if a list
  coin's buy delivers nothing, if the resulting shares round to zero, or if they are fewer than `minShares` (`TooFewShares(minted)`; every buy rolls back and nothing is paid). No price is read; no cap.
  A list coin whose holding is zero (its
  buy was skipped at the last rebalance) is not bought by `mint`, exactly as `held * f` says;
  the next `rebalance` buys it from idle IMD.
- Residuals (coins after `listCount` in `coins()`: they left the list and a rebalance could not
  fully sell them) are bought by `mint` like any holding, `held * f` of each. One whose pool
  trades but delivers less than asked (a transfer tax, liquidity that ran out) does not cut the
  shares: the shortfall is charged at the price the pool just traded at (`slot0` after the buy,
  rounded up) into the holders' idle IMD, so holders keep their value in a little more IMD. One
  whose pool rejects the index's buy outright (a dead pool, a hook that reverts, burns gas or
  leaves a delta unsettled, a swap that needs more than `SWAP_GAS`) is a failed buy: the mint
  reverts `BuyFailed(coin)` and takes nothing, exactly as a dead list coin does, until the pool
  works again or a rebalance sells the residual. It is never settled at a spot price nobody paid:
  that price can be moved by the minter in the same block, which would hand the residual to the
  new shares for pool fees (audit 3bd5e1aa, fixed in this launch).

While SwarmCity is held, its 2% transfer tax normally means about 98% of the requested later-mint
shares are issued (subject to integer rounding). The buyer still pays for every buy made, the
idle IMD contribution for the shares issued, and the 0.50% fee on the buys' cost. Other coins
bought in excess of the issued fraction remain backing the index for its holders.
`maxImdIn` limits the payment; it is not a minimum-share guarantee. Read `Minted.shares` for the
amount actually issued. The first mint's share calculation remains IMD paid less its 0.50% fee;
its coin receipts and `minOut` checks use the amounts actually received.

Minimum-shares floor: `minShares` is the fewest shares the buyer accepts. A buy that delivers only a
sliver of one coin (because that pool's liquidity is one-sided, bounded or was withdrawn just before
the mint) would issue only that sliver's fraction of the requested shares; with a floor set, the mint
reverts `TooFewShares` instead and every buy rolls back. `minShares = 0` keeps the old behaviour.
A site should pass about 97% of the requested shares (SwarmCity's 2% tax already costs about 2%).

### Redeem

- `redeem(shares)`: burns, then pays 99.50% of `held * f` of each coin and of `idleImd * f`
  (100% when the supply reaches 0; the 0.50% stays with the remaining holders). No price, no
  trade. Each transfer gets `PAY_GAS`; one that reverts, returns false, runs out of that gas or
  targets an address without code is recorded in `owed[caller][coin]` instead of blocking;
  `claim(coin)` takes it later and can only pay once.
- `redeemToImd(shares, minImdOut)`: same burn and `f`; sells `held * f` of each coin inside the
  PoolManager's `unlock`, adds `idleImd * f`, keeps 0.50% as `feeImd`, pays the rest in IMD and
  reverts under `minImdOut`. A coin whose sale reverts (or fills short) is paid in kind under
  the same rule as `redeem`: 99.50% of the unsold part, the rest staying with the remaining
  holders, and all of it when the supply reaches zero. Both redeem paths therefore pay the same
  amount of a coin that cannot be sold.

### Oracle

- `ask()`: anyone, when no request is open, no list awaits a rebalance, and 7 days have passed
  since the last ask. With under 0.75 IMD of `feeImd` it returns without doing anything.
  Otherwise it pays the Intake 0.5 IMD through `requestWithFailure` and the caller 0.25 IMD.
- The body is built on chain by `body()`: `v` 1, the question, chain 1, window 24 hours, answer
  type `bytes32[]`, evidence `panel`, panel 5, quorum 4, `validForSeconds` 86400, `head` 5 and
  `consumer {chainId: 1, verifyingContract: this}`.
- `onOracleResult`: only from the Intake, only for the open request, only with `agreed >= 4`:
  stores `keccak256(answer)` and closes the request. Every other case returns. It moves no
  tokens and runs well under 200,000 gas (tested with a 200,000 gas call).
- `onOracleFailure`: only from the Intake, for the open request: closes it. `closeRequest()`
  lets anyone close a request open for 2 days.
- `submit(attestation, signature)`: anyone. `keccak256(answer)` must equal the stored hash, the
  signed attestation must show `agreed >= 4`, it must be inside its validity window
  (`_verifyAttestation`: `AttestationExpired` past `expiresAt`, `AttestationNotYetValid` for an
  `issuedAt` more than five minutes ahead) and the signature must verify for the signer over
  this contract's EIP-712 digest (ECDSA, or
  ERC-1271 if the signer has code, through OpenZeppelin's `SignatureChecker`). Decodes 1 to 5
  distinct launch numbers (distinct tokens too), reads each token and hook from the registry that
  records it, reverts if either is missing, stores them as the next list and pays the caller
  0.25 IMD from `feeImd` if it can.

### Rebalance

`rebalance()`: anyone, when a next list is stored. Inside one `unlock`:

1. Sells every coin not in the next list into `idleImd`, each sale limited to a 2% price move.
2. Adopts the list. A leaver that step 1 could not fully sell (its pool is dead, or the 2% limit
   stopped the sale) stays in the holdings after the list, so it is still redeemed and minted
   proportionally and sold again by the next rebalance.
3. With four or more coins in the list, sells any holding above 25% of total value down to 25%,
   by pool spot prices read at the start of this step (`extsload` of the pool's `slot0`).
4. Spends `idleImd` on the list in equal parts; a buy stops at 25% weight or a 2% price move.

A swap that reverts is skipped (each swap is its own external self-call, `swapSelf`, so a revert
undoes only that swap). The skip holds against a hook the launch chose that misbehaves only for
the index: `swapSelf` is given `SWAP_GAS`, so a hook that burns all its gas costs one bounded
swap, and after settling, `swapSelf` reads the manager's transient nonzero-delta count
(`exttload` of Uniswap v4's `NonzeroDeltaCount` slot) and reverts if a hook left a delta of
its own unsettled, which the manager would otherwise only reject at the end of `unlock`,
undoing the whole rebalance. The caller gets 0.25 IMD from `feeImd` if it can pay.

`ask()` may be called again 7 days after the last ask even when an answer was delivered but
nobody submitted it; opening the new request clears the old answer's hash, so the week-old
attestation can no longer be submitted (it would otherwise rebalance the index twice in one
cycle: once on the stale list while the new request is open, once on the new one). This is
deliberate: an answer whose `submit` can never succeed (a launch number no registry records, a
missing artifact) must not block the oracle loop forever, and the cost is bounded to the normal
weekly 0.75 IMD. If the new request fails or times out, no answer is left; the loop waits for the
next interval as after any failed round.

## Security notes

- Every state-changing function is `nonReentrant` and emits an event. `unlockCallback` accepts
  only the PoolManager and only while one of the index's own operations holds the guard;
  `swapSelf` accepts only the contract itself. A hook or coin that re-enters hits the guard.
- IMD is pulled only from `msg.sender`; the PoolManager is paid with `transfer` from the index's
  own balance, never `transferFrom` with another payer.
- Shares are minted only against IMD actually paid: `mint` rounds every proportional amount up,
  charges the swaps' real cost plus fee and refuses a mint that would cost nothing;
  `mintFirst` refuses a buy that returns nothing and keeps the IMD the swaps did not consume
  as the holders' idle IMD, so the index can never reach a supply with nothing behind it.
- Redeem reads no price, makes no swap and cannot be blocked by a coin: failures become `owed`,
  each transfer is capped at `PAY_GAS` so a coin that burns gas cannot starve the next one, and
  `claim` zeroes the debt before paying.
- `feeImd` leaves only to the Intake (0.5 IMD) and as 0.25 IMD rewards.
- A forged callback (wrong sender, wrong request id, thin agreement) is ignored; a forged
  attestation fails the signature; a tampered field changes the digest.

Accepted, by the brief: thin-pool price impact, a pool's own hook fee, a dead pool blocking mint
(never redeem), a short fill that issues fewer shares than asked (above), and an oracle that
never answers. A hook that burns gas or leaves a delta unsettled for the index's swaps makes that
swap a skipped one in `rebalance` and an in-kind payment in `redeemToImd`; in `mint` and
`mintFirst` it is a failed buy, which reverts, as a dead pool does. That includes a residual: a
coin that left the list but could not be sold stays in the holdings so it is still redeemed, and
`mint` buys its fraction like any other holding. While its pool rejects the buy outright every
`mint` reverts `BuyFailed` until the pool works again or a rebalance sells it; a pool that trades
but fills short charges the shortfall at the price it traded at and never blocks the mint;
`redeem` and `redeemToImd` keep working either way (see Mint). Such
residuals also stay in the holdings until sold, so each unsellable leaver adds one coin to the
redeem, mint and rebalance loops; at the list's size (five coins, at most five leavers per
weekly rebalance) the cost grows slowly and `redeem` has `PAY_GAS` per coin, never more.
`submit` checks the stored hash, the signed quorum, the validity window and the signature: the
hash binds the answer to the index's own request and is cleared once a list is stored or a new
request opens, so an attestation is taken once and only for the cycle that produced it. It does
not compare the attestation's `requestId` or `questionHash` with the open request: the hash comes
only from the Intake's callback for this contract's own request, so a still-valid attestation
with byte-identical answer adopts the identical list (audit 57e3696c, informational).

Documented limits of the residual rule (audit be08f42a and 4acb1b2e, both low, not redesigned):

- A residual pool with no liquidity left in the buy direction does not revert on Uniswap v4: an
  exact-output swap fills what it can and leaves `slot0` at the price limit, so the shortfall's
  charge at that price is astronomical and the mint reverts `TooExpensive`. A mint can therefore
  request at most what every residual's pool can still deliver; a larger mint waits for the pool
  to be refilled or a rebalance to sell the residual.
- The residual's fraction is `held * shares / supply` for the shares asked, as for every coin.
  When a list coin fills short, the shares issued fall but the residual bought or charged does
  not, so the minter pays the residual's full requested fraction for fewer shares; the excess
  coin or IMD stays with the holders, as any coin bought beyond the issued fraction does. A
  buyer who will not accept a short fill sets `minShares`, which reverts the whole mint.
- `ask` debits `feeImd` by the oracle price before the Intake pulls it; the accounting
  invariant assumes the Intake pulls exactly `ORACLE_PRICE` in that call, as the version 2
  Intake does (audit f094a9a7, informational). The Intake forwards that payment to its `payTo`
  in the same call and holds nothing, so nothing comes back on a failed request either (audit
  e2325942, informational; source verified on Sourcify).
- `rebalance` measures its 2% limit and the `PoorFill` floor against the pool's price when it
  runs, so a caller who moves a pool first has the index trade at the moved price, bounded to
  about 1% of that pool's reserve per coin per week (audit 9f216ca3, low; documented, not
  redesigned; see "Findings in this launch").
- A limited sale sells about 1% of a pool's coin reserve per rebalance, so a larger leaver stays
  as a residual and is sold again each week (audit 0a7c3762, informational). A request that
  fails or is closed costs its week: `lastAsk` is set when the request opens (audit 18ca8bf9,
  informational).

Gas to supply: `rebalance` needs at most `SWAP_GAS` per swap it attempts (up to 5 sales of
leavers, one trim per holding and one buy per list coin) plus a few hundred thousand; `redeem`
needs `PAY_GAS` per coin plus overhead. Under that, a hostile hook or coin can still exhaust the
call, which then simply reverts and can be retried with more gas.

Tests passing is not an audit. Work holding other people's funds needs an independent
adversarial review before release.

## Operational responsibilities

Nothing is owned. After launch:

- Someone must `fund` at least 0.75 IMD of `feeImd` before the first `ask` can pay; mint and
  redeemToImd fees top it up afterwards.
- Someone must call `ask()` (weekly at most), `submit` the signed attestation the Intake
  delivered (it is in the `Answered` event's request and the oracle's receipt), and `rebalance()`.
  Each of the three pays its caller 0.25 IMD when `feeImd` can.
- If the oracle never calls back, anyone may `closeRequest()` after 2 days.
- The launch deploys `Imdex5` from its bytecode as built, with no arguments. No `launch.json` is
  written here; the manifest step writes it.

## Findings in this launch (audit of commit a578235)

The audit of this launch's code reported one low and three informational findings and nothing of
medium or above, so no code changed: the brief fixes medium and above and documents the rest.
Each was reproduced and is pinned in `test/Imdex5DocumentedLimits.t.sol`; the reproductions are
in `ADAPTATION.md` and the limits in `THREAT_MODEL.md`.

| Finding | Severity | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `9f216ca3…` `PoorFill` and the 2% limit are measured against the spot price the `rebalance` caller can set first, so a pre-moved pool is bought or sold at the moved price and booked. | low | Reproduced (a 44% pump of the entering coin's pool costs that one buy about 30% of its coins; a 31% dump of the leaver's pool costs its sale about the same). Documented as an accepted bound: a rebalance swap trades at most about 1% of a pool's reserve per coin per week, and on mainnet the 1.25% pool fee each way makes the sandwich net-negative for the mover. A reference price the caller cannot set is a redesign; not made. |
| `0a7c3762…` A limited sell clears only part of a leaving holding per rebalance, so residuals persist and every mint, redeem and rebalance loops over them. | info | Reproduced. A limited sale sells about 1% of the pool's coin reserve per rebalance (a 1% sqrt-price move), so a leaver larger than that stays as a residual and is sold again each week until gone. Residuals are the normal state after a list change; the gas growth is one coin per unsold leaver. |
| `18ca8bf9…` `ask()` commits the 7-day interval before the request's outcome, so a failed, closed or under-quorum request costs the whole week. | info | Reproduced: after `onOracleFailure` or `closeRequest`, `ask` reverts `AskTooSoon` until seven days after the failed ask, and the 0.75 IMD is spent. This is the "weekly at most" rule; documented. |
| `e2325942…` IMD the Intake might return on a failed request would be unaccounted and stranded (the auditor could not read the live Intake). | info | Does not reproduce. The version 2 Intake's source is verified on Sourcify (chain 1, `0xa43e…DE82`, full creation and runtime match): it forwards every payment to its `payTo` inside the request call, holds nothing, and `complete` on a failure only calls the failure selector. No IMD comes back, the mock matches, and invariant 1 holds across a failed request (tested). |

| File | Change and reason |
| --- | --- |
| `test/Imdex5DocumentedLimits.t.sol` | New: the four findings above as pinned limits (a pool moved before a rebalance is traded at the moved price and booked, within the stated bound, for a buy and for a sale; a limited sale sells about 1% of the reserve and the residual clears over weekly rebalances; a failed and a closed request each cost the week; a failed request leaves every IMD accounted). |
| `README.md`, `THREAT_MODEL.md`, `ADAPTATION.md` | This section, the accepted limits and the reproductions. No change to `src/`: runtime stays 23,552 bytes. 177 unit and fuzz tests and 8 mainnet fork tests. |

## Changes for the previous revision (from launch 2343's code)

In-house audit of launch 2343's deployed code against audit 705dd677 (run on an earlier commit):
its medium and two lows were still open and are fixed here.

| File | Change and reason |
| --- | --- |
| `src/Imdex5.sol` | `swapSelf`: a swap that is not exact-output and takes its input but delivers nothing reverts `NothingOut`, so `rebalance` (`_tryBuy`, `_trySell`) and `redeemToImd` skip it instead of booking it (audit 705dd677, medium: rebalance spent idle IMD for no coins and sold coins for no IMD). A rebalance (`limited`) swap must also deliver at least half its input's value at the pool's price before the swap, or it reverts `PoorFill` and is skipped: without it a pool paying 1 wei passed the zero check. A hook may still keep up to half on a rebalance swap; that is the accepted bound. A mint's exact-output residual buy is exempt from both, so a short fill there is still charged at the pool price and mint stays open. |
| `src/Imdex5.sol` | `_swap`: the swap amount is converted with `SafeCast.toInt256` (audit 705dd677, low). `_mintMore`: `minShares > shares` reverts `TooFewShares` before any buy (audit 705dd677, low). |
| `test/Imdex5RebalanceNothingOut.t.sol` | New: rebalance buy and sell that pay nothing are skipped (both fail on launch 2343's code); a buy that pays 1 wei is skipped, one that pays 60% trades. |
| `test/Imdex5Revised.t.sol`, `test/Imdex5TaxEverywhere.t.sol` | Tests that pinned the old booking now assert the skip; a `redeemToImd` sale that would pay nothing pays that coin in kind. |
| `THREAT_MODEL.md`, `README.md` | Describe the shipped behaviour. Runtime 23,552 bytes; 171 unit and fuzz tests (177 with the documented-limits suite above) and 8 mainnet fork tests pass. |

Known limit, documented (not redesigned for this launch): a residual whose pool rejects every buy
forever blocks `mint` until a `rebalance` sells it; `redeem` and `redeemToImd` keep paying.

## Changes for launch 2343 (from launch 1668's code with the 886e7c22 fixes)

Audit of the code as it arrived: 1 medium, 2 low, 3 informational. The medium is fixed; the
rest are documented above (Mint, Oracle and Security notes). Reproductions are in
`ADAPTATION.md`.

| File | Change and reason |

| `src/Imdex5.sol` | `_mintMore`, residual branch: a residual whose `swapSelf` reverts is a failed buy (`revert BuyFailed(coin)`) instead of being charged at the pool's spot price. The spot price of a pool that just refused to trade is movable by the minter in the same block, so the old settlement handed the residual's value to the new shares for pool fees and gas (audit 3bd5e1aa, medium). The short-fill path (the pool traded, at that price) is unchanged. +36 bytes of runtime. |
| `test/Imdex5ResidualSpot.t.sol` | New: the audit's reproduction (dump 1,000x, buy reverts, mint the whole supply) now reverts and takes nothing, fuzzed over any dump factor and size; a residual hook that burns gas or leaves a delta fails the mint; a dumped pool that trades is bought in full and dilutes nobody; a short fill is charged at least its fair value. |
| `test/Imdex5Edges.t.sol` | `test_residualsAreRedeemedAndADeadOneDoesNotBlockMint` became `test_residualsAreRedeemedAndADeadOneBlocksMintWithoutTakingImd`: the dead residual now reverts the mint, redeems keep working, the mint buys it again once the pool is back. |
| `test/Imdex5.invariant.t.sol` | Comment only: the mint handler's residual note names both audits; a reverting residual is absorbed by its `catch` like any revert. |
| `test/Fix3*.fork.t.sol` | Skip (`vm.skip`) when the mainnet IMD contract has no code, so `forge test` passes with no network; with `--fork-url` they run as before. |
| `README.md`, `THREAT_MODEL.md`, `ADAPTATION.md` | Describe the shipped behaviour: `submit` checks the window and quorum; a residual's buy that reverts blocks mint, a short fill does not (audit 357a7068, informational); the two low findings and the two other informational ones are documented as limits. |

## Changes for the corrected launch (1636 to 1668)

Every change from the supplied launch 1636 project is listed here; audit reproduction and
validation details are in `ADAPTATION.md`.

| File | Change and reason |
| --- | --- |
| `src/Imdex5.sol` | `_swap` measures the balance increase around `take`, returning and emitting the actual receipt so transfer tax cannot inflate holdings. `_mintMore` issues the least delivered fraction of requested shares, rejects zero output/zero resulting shares, and emits the actual shares while charging all buys and fees; its idle IMD contribution is `idleImd * minted / supply` (rounded up), computed after the buys, so a short fill is not charged the requested fraction of idle IMD for fewer shares (review finding, revision 2). `ask()` clears `answerHash` when it opens a new request, so an unsubmitted answer of the previous cycle cannot be submitted and rebalanced on while the new request is open (review finding, revision 2). The mint NatSpec describes this behavior. |
| `test/mocks/Mocks.sol` | Makes the mock's `transfer` public and virtual so the taxed mock can reuse its balances and failure modes. Plain-token behavior is unchanged. |
| `test/mocks/PoolTaxERC20.sol` | Adds a mock that keeps 2% of transfers from the PoolManager; transfers from the index remain untaxed. |
| `test/Imdex5.t.sol` | Replaces the obsolete nonzero short-fill revert expectation with fractional issuance and balance assertions; retains the failed-buy revert check. |
| `test/Imdex5ShortFill.t.sol` | Adds deterministic and fuzz tests for short fills, the least fill across all coins, full payment and refunds, zero output, zero rounded shares, payment limits and atomic rollback. Revision 2: the idle contribution of a short fill equals the issued shares' fraction and the minter's pro-rata idle claim equals its deposit to rounding; a sliver fill issues a sliver, pays every buy and dilutes nobody. |
| `test/Imdex5TaxedCoin.t.sol` | Adds the first receipt and last-holder regressions, the complete three-holder lifecycle with two later mints and an IMD exit, fuzzed lifecycles, actual-output events and minimums, rebalance buys, and funded owed/claim coverage. Each lifecycle step checks balances against held plus owed; each mint checks backing against every holding and, since revision 2, that idle IMD is charged for the shares issued. |
| `test/Imdex5.invariant.t.sol` | Checks minted shares against actual receipts and proportional backing (and, since revision 2, the idle contribution against the shares issued); runs the existing invariants both with plain tokens and with the taxed SwarmCity mock. The held-plus-owed invariant is retained. |
| `test/Imdex5Edges.t.sol` | Revision 2: a later ask drops the unsubmitted answer at once, so the stale attestation is rejected while the new request is open and after the new request fails. |
| `README.md` | Updates the measured runtime size, corrects accounting and mint descriptions, documents the short-fill payment consequence and lists this change set. |
| `ADAPTATION.md` | Records the changes, imported findings, reproductions, unchanged launch requirements and local validation. |
